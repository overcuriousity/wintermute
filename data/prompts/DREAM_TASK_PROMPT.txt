Below are the active tasks (tracked goals and scheduled actions) for a personal AI assistant.

Review each item and return a JSON array of actions to take. Valid actions:
- {{"action": "keep", "id": "<task_id>"}} — task is still relevant, no change
- {{"action": "complete", "id": "<task_id>"}} — task is done or clearly stale
- {{"action": "update", "id": "<task_id>", "content": "new text"}} — reword/merge
- {{"action": "update", "id": "<task_id>", "priority": <1-10>}} — adjust priority

For scheduled tasks: prefer "keep" unless the schedule is clearly obsolete.
Use "complete" only for tasks that are genuinely finished or no longer needed.

Return ONLY the JSON array, no preamble or explanation.
