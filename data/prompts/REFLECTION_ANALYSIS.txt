Based on this data, provide brief observations:
1. What patterns do you see in the failures?
2. Are any tasks misconfigured or need adjustment?
3. Should any skills be updated or retired?

After your observations, end your response with this JSON block on its own line:
{"skill_actions": []}

If you recommend a skill change, add a brief English instruction per action:
{"skill_actions": ["Review and update data/skills/example.md - correlates with 3 failures"]}
