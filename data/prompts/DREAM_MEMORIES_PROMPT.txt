Below is the current long-term memory store for a personal AI assistant ({source}). Memories are appended throughout the day and may contain duplicates or near-duplicates.

Your task is to consolidate it:
- Merge duplicate and near-duplicate entries into single concise statements.
- Remove entries that are clearly outdated or contradicted by newer entries.
- Preserve all useful facts about the user preferences exactly.
- Keep the result as short as possible without losing information.
- Maintain a flat, scannable structure (one fact per line or short paragraph).

Return ONLY the consolidated memory content, with no preamble or explanation.
