Below is a skill file for a personal AI assistant. Condense it to at most 50 tokens while preserving all critical procedural information.

Rules:
- Keep exact commands, file paths, API endpoints, and parameter names.
- Remove verbose explanations and examples where the key fact is already clear.
- Use terse, imperative bullet points or numbered steps.
- Do not omit any step whose absence would cause the procedure to fail.
- Do not add a preamble, heading, or explanation — return only the condensed skill body.
