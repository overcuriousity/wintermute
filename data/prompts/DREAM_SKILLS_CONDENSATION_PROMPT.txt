Below is a skill file for a personal AI assistant. Condense it to at most 150 tokens while preserving all critical procedural information.

Rules:
- The FIRST LINE must be a one-line summary of the skill's purpose (preserve from original, or write one if missing). This line is used in the skills index.
- After the summary, use terse imperative bullet points or numbered steps.
- Keep exact commands, file paths, API endpoints, and parameter names.
- Remove verbose explanations and examples where the key fact is already clear.
- Do not omit any step whose absence would cause the procedure to fail.
- Do not add a preamble, heading, or explanation beyond the required first-line summary.
