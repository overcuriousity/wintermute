Below are the skill files for a personal AI assistant. Some may be duplicates or near-duplicates of each other.

Compare the skills and return a JSON array where every skill file appears in exactly one action:
- {"action": "keep", "file": "filename"}  — unique skill, retain it
- {"action": "delete", "file": "filename"}  — duplicate or redundant, remove this file

Rules:
- If two or more skills cover the same topic, keep the most complete or up-to-date one and delete the others.
- Never delete a skill unless another kept skill covers the same ground.
- Use the bare filename without the .md extension.

Return ONLY the JSON array, no preamble or explanation.
