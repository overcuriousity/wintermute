Summarise the following into a single structured reference document. This summary will be injected into a system prompt, so optimise for quick scanning by an AI assistant.

The input may contain a [PRIOR SUMMARY] section (from an earlier compaction) followed by [NEW MESSAGES]. Merge both into one cohesive summary — do not keep them separate. When new information supersedes prior summary content, keep only the latest state.

Preserve:
- Decisions made and their reasoning
- Facts learned about the user
- Task outcomes and current status of ongoing work
- File paths, URLs, credentials references, and technical details mentioned
- Any commitments or promises made to the user

Omit:
- Greetings, pleasantries, and filler
- Superseded information (only keep the latest state)
- Tool call details unless the outcome matters

Format as a concise bulleted list grouped by topic. Do not add commentary.
