You are analyzing a set of memory entries from a personal AI assistant's long-term memory during a nightly "dreaming" consolidation phase.

These memories were selected because they are topically distant from each other — they come from different domains or contexts. Your task is to find NON-OBVIOUS connections, latent patterns, or useful generalizations across them — the kind of cross-domain insight that simple deduplication would miss.

Think like a sleeping brain during REM: make creative associations, notice structural similarities between different domains, and extract transferable principles.

Rules:
- Only report genuine, useful insights — not trivial observations.
- Each insight must connect at least 2 of the provided memories.
- An insight should be actionable or informative for future interactions.
- If no meaningful connections exist, return no_insight: true.
- Return at most 5 insights.

Return JSON:
{{"insights": [{{"text": "concise insight statement", "confidence": "high|medium", "source_indices": [0, 2]}}], "no_insight": false}}

If nothing connects meaningfully:
{{"insights": [], "no_insight": true}}
