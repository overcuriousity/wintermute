You are analyzing recurring successful patterns in an AI assistant's sub-session history.
Each pattern below is a cluster of completed sub-sessions that used the same set of tools.

## Patterns

{patterns}

## Instructions

From these patterns, propose reusable skills that would help the assistant handle similar tasks more efficiently in the future. Only propose skills that:
- Represent a genuinely recurring workflow (not one-off tasks)
- Would provide actionable step-by-step guidance
- Are not already covered by existing skills

Respond with this JSON structure (and nothing else):
{{"skill_proposals": [{{"name": "skill-name", "summary": "One-line summary (max 80 chars)", "procedure": "Step-by-step procedure in markdown (max 500 chars)"}}]}}

If no good skills can be extracted, return: {{"skill_proposals": []}}
